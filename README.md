# Project Title

A graphical application built using Python's `tkinter` for the user interface, `pygame` for sound, and `matplotlib` for data visualization. This project also utilizes threading for improved performance.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The application uses `tkinter` to create a user-friendly interface.
- **Sound Integration:** `pygame` is used to handle sound effects.
- **Randomization:** Random functionalities are implemented with the `random` library for various tasks.
- **Multithreading:** Threading is used to ensure smooth execution without freezing the GUI.
- **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib` is used to generate graphs and charts, displayed within the `tkinter` window using `FigureCanvasTkAgg`.

- The following Python libraries:
  - `os`
  - `tkinter`
  - `pygame`
  - `random`
  - `threading`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
